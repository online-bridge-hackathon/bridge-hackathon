Bridge Hackathon is a real, currently online-only hackathon, started on 23 May 2020. The hackathon participants created a modular suite of cloud-native services (projects) to build multiple, modern end user applications, such as a Bridge game server (improving on the work of BBO, OK Bridge, BCL, FunBridge, etc).
