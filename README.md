Bridge Hackathon is a real, currently online-only hackathon, started on 23 May 2020. The hackathon participants created a modular suite of cloud-native services (projects) to build multiple, modern end user applications, such as a Bridge game server (improving on the work of BBO, OK Bridge, BCL, FunBridge, etc).

## Projects
1. [DDS](https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/DDS) - An api that returns DDS results for a given deal or partial deal
2. [Deal](https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/Deal) - A web service that accepts request by APIs and returns 1+ bridge deals
3. [OCR](https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/OCR) - Optical Character Recognition API that converts deal images to text format
4. [Data Converter](https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/Data-Converter) - Converts bridge deal data formats between JSON, PBN, etc
5. [Tournament] - Organises users, tables, deals, scores  (not yet created; name may change)
6. [Scores] - Accepts contract results and returns scores  (not yet created; name may change)
7. [Storage] - Storage for played deals (not yet created; name may change)
8. [Platform] - Play server where users can play bridge  (not yet created; name may change)

## Common Standards
* [data-conversion-api] (https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/data-conversion-api) - An API for converting different file formats (pbn, lin) to JSON
* [data-formats] (https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/data-formats) - Specifications and Example JSONs

## Roadmap
![Bridge Hackathon Roadmap](https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/bridge-hackathon/blob/master/Bridge%20Hackathon%20Roadmap.png)

### A platform where...

##### ...bridge players 
- can play an informal match with friends
- can play a match with their bridge club
- can invite a partner (or robot) to join in any match by URL (link)
- can watch one or more live or recorded matches in a multi-pane viewer, e.g. both tables at a teams match
- can play in more than one match at the same time (obviously with limitations: e.g. not in the same tournament)
- can join a variety of groups (table, tournament, friends)
- can set up their own group (create once - each group persists across logins)
- can invite friends to join their group
- can chat via text and emojii with any group
- can chat via video with their table group
- can import or link groups of friends from other chat platforms (WhatsApp, Hangouts, WeChat, Messenger) 
- can join an interactive bridge class with a teacher

#### ...bridge organisers, particularly clubs (local, regional, national, international)
- can organiser their online bridge clubs
- can hold one-off matches
- can run 

#### ...bridge teachers
- can schedule or create ad-hoc classes of multiple tables
- can set up a class (group)
- can invite learners to join a class by URL (link)
- can assign learners to a table or allow them to choose their own
- can generate specific sets of deals and store them on the platform for retrieval any time
- can easily choose deals (random or specific) for each or all the tables
- can chat via text and emojii with any group (class, table)
- can chat via video with any group (class, table)
- can display hands dynamically in the group (class, table)
