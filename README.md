Bridge Hackathon is a real, currently online-only hackathon, started on 23 May 2020. The hackathon participants created a modular suite of cloud-native services (projects) to build multiple, modern end user applications, such as a Bridge game server (improving on the work of BBO, OK Bridge, BCL, FunBridge, etc).

## Projects
1. [DDS](https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/DDS) - An api which returns DDS results for a given board
2. [Deal](https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/Deal) - A web service that accepts request by APIs and returns 1+ bridge deals
3. [play-engine](https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/play-engine) - A play engine using services to enable users to play bridge online
4. [OCR](https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/OCR) - Optical Character Recognition API that converts deal images to text format
5. [Tournament] - Organises users, tables, deals, scores (not yet created)
6. [Scores] - Accepts contract results and returns scores (not yet created)
7. [Played Deal] - Used to store played deals (not yet created)

## Common Standards
* [data-conversion-api] (https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/data-conversion-api) - An API for converting different file formats (pbn, lin) to JSON
* [data-formats] (https://github.com/online-bridge-hackathon/data-formats) - Specifications and Example JSONs
